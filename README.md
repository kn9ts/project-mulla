> __What MPESA G2 API should have been in the 21st century.__

> __PLEASE NOTE: Mediates only C2B portion for now.__

<p class="lead"><strong>Project Mulla is a MPESA API RESTful mediator</strong>. It lets you make familiar HTTP REST requests, <strong>transforming your requests</strong> to the fiddling dreaded SOAP/XML requests that the Safaricom MPESA G2 API only understands. It then communicates with the MPESA API gateway, transforming all SOAP responses from the SAG to <strong>RESTful JSON responses</strong> that you then consume effortlessly.</p>
<blockquote>In short, it’ll deal with all of the SOAP shenanigans while you REST. Everybody wins!</blockquote>

The aim of **Project Mulla** is to create a REST API middleman that interfaces with the **MPESA G2 API** for you.

### Yes We Know! SOAP! Yuck!

Developers should not go through the **trauma** involved with dealing with SOAP/XML in the 21st century.

# Example of how it works

## Request Payment

This initial step is to tell the SAG to initialise a payment transaction for you. After
initialisation, you then make another request to the SAG as a confirmation signaling the SAG to
process the payment request.

Assuming __Project Mulla__ is now your mediator, you'd now make a __POST__ request to
__Project Mulla__. _Not the Safaricom Access Gateway_.

See below how you'd make this initial request:

### Initiate Payment Request:

__`POST`__ __`https://project-mulla-companyname.herokuapp.com/api/v1/payment/request`__

_Body Parameters_:

- `phoneNumber` - The phone number of your client
- `totalAmount` - The total amount you are charging the client
- `referenceID` [optional] - The reference ID of the order or service
- `merchantTransactionID` [optional] - This specific order's or service's transaction ID

> __NOTE:__ If `merchantTransactionID` or `referenceID` are not provided a time-based and random
UUID is generated for each respectively.

### Sample request using CURL in the command line/terminal:

```bash
$ curl -i -X POST \
--url http://project-mulla-companyname.herokuapp.com/api/v1/payment/request \
--data 'phoneNumber=254723000000' \
--data 'totalAmount=45.00' \
--data 'clientName="Eugene Mutai"' \
--data 'clientLocation=Kilimani' \
```

### Expected Response

If all goes well you get HTTP status code __`200`__ accompanied with a similar structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "return_code": "00",
    "status_code": 200,
    "message": "Transaction carried successfully",
    "trx_id": "453c70c4b2434bd94bcbafb17518dc8e",
    "description": "success",
    "cust_msg": "to complete this transaction, enter your bonga pin on your handset. if you don't have one dial *126*5# for instructions",
    "reference_id": "3e3beff0-fc05-417a-bbf2-190ee19a5e58",
    "merchant_transaction_id": "95d64500-2514-11e6-bcb8-a7f8e1c786c4",
    "amount_in_double_float": "45.00",
    "client_phone_number": "254723001575",
    "extra_payload": {},
    "time_stamp": "20160528234142"
  }
}
```

## Next step: confirmation

You are to use `trx_id` or `merchant_transaction_id` to make the confirmation payment
request. The confirmation request is to authorize the SAG to process the payment request. On confirmation, it
triggers a pop up on your client's mobile phone to complete the payment.

# Installation

Installing Project Mulla is easy and straight-forward, but there are a few requirements you’ll need
to make sure your system has before you start.

## Requirements

You will need to install some stuff, if they are not yet installed in your machine:

* [Node.js (v4.3.2 or higher; LTS)](http://nodejs.org)
* [NPM (v3.5+; bundled with node.js installation package)](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#updating-npm)

If you've already installed the above you may need to only update **npm** to the latest version:

```bash
$ sudo npm update -g npm
```

---

## Install through Github

Best way to install Project Mulla is to clone it from Github

**To clone/download the boilerplate**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kn9ts/project-mulla.git
```

**After cloning, get into your cloned Project Mulla's directory/folder**

```bash
$ cd project-mulla
```

**Install all of the projects dependencies with:**

```bash
$ npm install
```

__Create `app.yaml` configurations file__

The last but not the least step is to create a `app.yaml` file with your configurations in the root
directory of `project-mulla`.

This is the same folder directory where `index.js` can be found.

Your `app.yaml` should look like the example below, only with your specific configuration values:

```yaml
env_variables:
  PAYBILL_NUMBER: '898998'
  PASSKEY: 'a8eac82d7ac1461ba0348b0cb24d3f8140d3afb9be864e56a10d7e8026eaed66'
  MERCHANT_ENDPOINT: 'http://merchant-endpoint.com/mpesa/payment/complete'

# Everything below is only relevant if you are looking
# to deploy Project Mulla to Google App Engine.
runtime: nodejs
vm: true

skip_files:
  - ^(.*/)?.*/node_modules/.*$
```

*__NOTE:__ The `PAYBILL_NUMBER` and `PASSKEY` are provided by Safaricom once you have registered for the MPESA G2 API.*

*__NOTE:__ The details above only serve as examples*

# Testing

## It's now ready to launch

First run the command `npm test` on your terminal and see if everything is all good. Then run:

```bash
$ npm start

> project-mulla@0.1.1 start ../project-mulla
> node index.js

Your secret session key is: 5f06b1f1-1bff-470d-8198-9ca2f18919c5
Express server listening on 8080, in development mode
```

## Docker Container
You may as well just run Project Mulla as a docker container. No need for all the installation if you already have docker installed or you are familiar with containers,
or better yet, you just want to run Project Mulla as a microservice.

Once you have cloned the repo, got into the project-mulla directory and created your **app.yaml** file as described above, make sure your docker daemon is running 
and build project-mulla into a container.

Please note depending on your docker setup you may require to append the commands below with sudo
# Building the project-mulla image
```
$ docker build -t project-mulla:1.0 .
```

The build instructions are included the Dockerfile, the docker run options -d and -p are included so as to run the project-mulla container in detached mode
and also to expose the port 8080 from the container to the host. If you would prefer not to run the container in detached mode just swap the -d for -t which allocates
a pseudo TTY for the container 

# Running a container from project-mulla image
```
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080  project-mulla:1.0
```
It's up n running. You can go ahead and do the test run below now.

# Stopping the project-mulla container
Issue the command below and grab the name/id of the project-mulla container
```
$ docker ps 
```
Followed by
```
$ docker stop <id/name>
```
## Do a test run

Now make a test run using **CURL**:

```bash
$ curl -i -X POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/api/v1/payment/request \
  --data 'phoneNumber=254723000000' \
  --data 'totalAmount=10.00' \
  --data 'clientName="Eugene Mutai"' \
  --data 'clientLocation=Kilimani' \
```

Or if you have [httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) installed:

```bash
$ http POST localhost:8080/api/v1/payment/request \
  phoneNumber=254723000000 \
  totalAmount=10.00 \
  clientName='Eugene Mutai' \
  clientLocation='Kilimani'
```

Once the request is executed, your console should print a similar structured **response** as below:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Length: 534
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    "description": "success",

    "merchant_transaction_id": "95d64500-2514-11e6-bcb8-a7f8e1c786c4",
    "amount_in_double_float": "10.00",
    "client_phone_number": "254723001575",
    "extra_payload": {},
    "time_stamp": "20160528234142"
  }
}
```
