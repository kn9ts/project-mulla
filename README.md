> __What MPESA G2 API should have been in the 21st century.__

> __PLEASE NOTE: Mediates only C2B portion for now.__

<p class="lead"><strong>Project Mulla is a MPESA API RESTful mediator</strong>. It lets you make familiar HTTP REST requests, <strong>transforming your requests</strong> to the fiddling dreaded SOAP/XML requests that the Safaricom MPESA G2 API only understands. It then communicates with the MPESA API gateway, transforming all SOAP responses from the SAG to <strong>RESTful JSON responses</strong> that you then consume effortlessly.</p>
<blockquote>In short, it’ll deal with all of the SOAP shenanigans while you REST. Everybody wins!</blockquote>

The aim of **Project Mulla** is to create a REST API middleman that interfaces with the **MPESA G2 API** for you.

### Yes We Know! SOAP! Yuck!

Developers should not go through the **trauma** involved with dealing with SOAP/XML in the 21st century.

# Example of how it works

## Request Payment

This is initial step is to tell the SAG to initialise a payment you want to transact. After
initialisation, you then make another request to the SAG as a confirmation signaling the SAG to
process the payment request requested.

Assuming __Project Mulla__ is now your mediator, you'd now make a __POST__ request to
__Project Mulla__. _Not the Safaricom Access Gateway_.

See below how you'd make this initial request:

### Initiate Payment Request:

__`POST`__ __`https://project-mulla-companyname.herokuapp.com/api/v1/payment/request`__

_Body Parameters_:

- `phoneNumber` - The phone number of your client
- `totalAmount` - The total amount you are charging the client
- `referenceID` [optional] - The reference ID of the order or service
- `merchantTransactionID` [optional] - This specific order's or service's transaction ID

> __NOTE:__ If `merchantTransactionID` or `referenceID` are not provided a time-based and random
UUID is generated for each respectively.

### Sample request using CURL in the command line/terminal:

```bash
$ curl -i -X POST \
--url http://project-mulla-companyname.herokuapp.com/api/v1/payment/request \
--data 'phoneNumber=254723000000' \
--data 'totalAmount=45.00' \
--data 'clientName="Eugene Mutai"' \
--data 'clientLocation=Kilimani' \
```

### Expected Response

If all goes well you get HTTP status code __`200`__ accompanied with the a similar structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "return_code": "00",
    "status_code": 200,
    "message": "Transaction carried successfully",
    "trx_id": "453c70c4b2434bd94bcbafb17518dc8e",
    "description": "success",
    "cust_msg": "to complete this transaction, enter your bonga pin on your handset. if you don't have one dial *126*5# for instructions",
    "reference_id": "3e3beff0-fc05-417a-bbf2-190ee19a5e58",
    "merchant_transaction_id": "95d64500-2514-11e6-bcb8-a7f8e1c786c4",
    "amount_in_double_float": "45.00",
    "client_phone_number": "254723001575",
    "extra_payload": {},
    "time_stamp": "20160528234142"
  }
}
```

## Next step: confirmation

You are to use `trx_id` or `merchant_transaction_id` to make the confirmation payment
request. The confirmation request is the request the payment requested above to be processed and
triggers a pop up on the your client's mobile phone.

# Installation & Testing

# Installation

Installing Project Mulla is easy and straight-forward, but there are a few requirements you’ll need
to make sure your system has before you start.

## Requirements

You will need to install some stuff, if they are not yet installed in your machine:

* [Node.js (v4.3.2 or higher; LTS)](http://nodejs.org)
* [NPM (v3.5+; bundled with node.js installation package)](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#updating-npm)

If you've already installed the above you may need to only update **npm** to the latest version:

```bash
$ sudo npm update -g npm
```

---

## Install with Github

Best way to install Project Mulla is to clone it from Github

**To clone/download the boilerplate**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kn9ts/project-mulla.git
```

**After cloning, get into your cloned Project Mulla's directory/folder**

```bash
$ cd project-mulla
```

**Install all of the projects dependencies with:**

```bash
$ npm install
```

__Create `app.yaml` configurations file__

The last but not least step is creating a `app.yaml` file with your configurations in the root 
directory of `project-mulla`.

This is the same folder estate where `index.js` can be found.

It should look like the example below, only with your specific config values:

```yaml
env_variables:
  PAYBILL_NUMBER: '898998'
  PASSKEY: 'a8eac82d7ac1461ba0348b0cb24d3f8140d3afb9be864e56a10d7e8026eaed66'
  MERCHANT_ENDPOINT: 'http://merchant-endpoint.com/mpesa/payment/complete'

# Everything below is only relevant if you are looking
# to deploy Project Mulla to Google App Engine.
runtime: nodejs
vm: true

skip_files:
  - ^(.*/)?.*/node_modules/.*$
```

*__NOTE:__ The `PAYBILL_NUMBER` and `PASSKEY` are provided by Safaricom once you have registered for the MPESA G2 API.*

*__NOTE:__ The details above only serve as examples*

## It's now ready to launch

1st run the command `npm test` in the console and see if everything is all good. Then run:

```bash
$ npm start

> project-mulla@0.1.1 start ../project-mulla
> node index.js

Your secret session key is: 5f06b1f1-1bff-470d-8198-9ca2f18919c5
Express server listening on 8080, in development mode
```

## Do a test run

Now make a test run using **CURL**:

```bash
$ curl -i -X POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/api/v1/payment/request \
  --data 'phoneNumber=254723000000' \
  --data 'totalAmount=10.00' \
  --data 'clientName="Eugene Mutai"' \
  --data 'clientLocation=Kilimani' \
```

Or if you have [httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) installed:

```bash
$ http POST localhost:8080/api/v1/payment/request \
  phoneNumber=254723000000 \
  totalAmount=10.00 \
  clientName='Eugene Mutai' \
  clientLocation='Kilimani'
```

Once the request is executed, your console should print a similar structured **response** as below:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 534
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    "extra_payload": {},
    "time_stamp": "20160528234142"
  }
}
```
